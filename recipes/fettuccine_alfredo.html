    <h1>Fettuccine Alfredo</h1>
    <h2>Desciption:</h2>
    <p>In the early 1900s, Italian restaurateur Alfredo Di Lelio started serving plates of pasta, cheese, and butter at his restaurant in Rome. Known today as fettuccine Alfredo, the dish gained more fame in the past century in the U.S. than in its home country. But it also evolved in its new environs, and American cooks added heavy cream to thicken and enrich the sauce, and sometimes tossed the pasta with chicken or shrimp. To each their own, but no real fettuccine Alfredo recipe should ever (ever!) include cream.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces fettuccine or other long pasta</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>3/4 cup finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Preparation:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente. Drain, reserving 2 cups pasta cooking liquid.</p></li>
            <li><p>Transfer 1 cup pasta cooking liquid to a large skillet. Bring to a gentle simmer, then whisk in butter, no more than 1 tablespoon at a time, until melted. Whisking constantly, gradually add cheese, making sure itâ€™s completely melted and incorporated before adding more. Add pasta and toss to coat, adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed, until sauce blankets noodles completely. Serve topped with pepper and more cheese.</p></li>
